# Personal Portfolio Webpage - Version 1 #
## 00. Bootcamp Note ##
I struggled with this a lot - I had a lot of difficulty with the Flexbox and responsive design CSS week, and I've been unwell this week too. I have asked my Student Success Manager how to apply for an extension - because I feel like I could do with more time on this over the Christmas break, but I think she is on annual leave at the moment. 

I have submitted the work I had done on this project so far - however I know it doesn't meet the brief at all yet. I decided I need to go back to the week two sessions on Flexbox and Responsive Design before attempting the main challenges. I intend to look at it again and resubmit the assignment at a later date.

### 00B. Revision Tasks ###
 - Attempt exercises again from Week 2 / Session 1
 - - Media Query Screen
 - - Flexbox Layout
 - - Responsive Design
 - - Flexbox Placement
 - - Box Styling
 - - Might also be worth looking at Box Model
 - Work these concepts into portfolio website draft as they are covered
 - Look at relevant tutorials on Codecademy for CSS, as this seems to explain things more clearly

## 01: Project Outline ##
### Description
This is a single webpage styled with CSS, that is designed to give information about me and share the coding projects I have recently worked on. While the projects themselves are only skeletons now, I hope to update and add to this as I develop my coding skills.

The list of objectives I need to complete for this project itself are:
 - Create a website with my NAME, a PHOTO, an ABOUT ME, some WORK EXAMPLES and a CONTACT ME section.
 - A navigation bar that scrolls to the corresponding section
 - The section work examples has titled images about my work
 - The first application needs to be larger than the others
 - The images must link to the deployed application
 - The page must resize responsively for different sized screens

 A list of additional tasks I would like to then work on:
 - Add a reset css style sheet, to make styling consistent between browsers

### Problems
#### Nav Bar and Section Margins
I can't seem to get the sections to consistently fall 65px below the header. I could try giving everything a 65
