** Personal Portfolio: Version 1.0 **
This is a single webpage styled with CSS, that is designed to give information about me and share the coding projects I have recently worked on. While the projects themselves are only skeletons now, I hope to update and add to this as I develop my coding skills.

The list of objectives I need to complete for this project itself are:
 - Create a website with my NAME, a PHOTO, an ABOUT ME, some WORK EXAMPLES and a CONTACT ME section.
 - A navigation bar that scrolls to the corresponding section
 - The section work examples has titled images about my work
 - The first application needs to be larger than the others
 - The images must link to the deployed application
 - The page must resize responsively for different sized screens

 A list of additional tasks I would like to then work on:
 - Add a reset css style sheet, to make styling consistent between browsers
